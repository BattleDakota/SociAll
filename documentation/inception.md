### Interview 1:

**Summary:** Gia Neve found that SociAll would mostly be used in a business marketing sense, but has potential in a laidback social setting. She had many ideas
and contributions to potential features, finding that it would be most useful to have dedicated settings for non-professional and professional profiles/engagement capabilities.

**Interviewer:** Ethan Baranowski

**Interviewee:** Gia Neve

**When:** 02/05/2021

**Consumer Segments:**

**Key insights:** Believes that two separate settings for buisness settings and social settings should be implemented. Gia states that she 
 would not post anything important to Facebook or Twitter unless it was for business purposes. Concerns around formatting for each media site also
 brought concern. She also believed that in a "non-professional" setting, multiple posting abilities would be nice to have. In addition, she was in favor
 of extra security and password storing but was confused on the functionailty of it. (Had thoughts on in-app encrypted key operations)

**Representative quotes:** "I believe the app has a lot of potential for increasing traffic for businesses, but also easing the efforts of connecting with friends in a public setting"

**Assessment: (Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care):** Gia thought this app would be "nice to have", but a "must have" in for marketing focused individuals.

**Assessment: (Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care)** For Skyeler, if it had all his steaming and game stuff, it would be a must have.

### Interview 3:

**Summary:** If it was a password manager, Jess would prefer not to be using that feature.
